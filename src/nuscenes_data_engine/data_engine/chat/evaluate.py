"""Answer-correctness eval for the dataset-chat agent — deterministic, no LLM judge.

Ground truth comes from a ``reference_sql`` per case, executed through the SAME guarded
catalog the agent uses, so a case can never ask for something the agent is structurally
unable to answer. Every check is a pure function over the agent's own output, so the
grading logic is unit-testable without a live model (design:
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-11-chat-eval-harness-design.md).
